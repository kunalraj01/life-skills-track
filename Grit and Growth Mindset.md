# The Internal Locus of Control

### Internal Locus of Control
Internal locus of control is the belief that your outcomes are determined by your own actions and decisions. People with an internal locus of control believe that they have control over their own destiny. They are more likely to take action to achieve their goals because they believe that they can make a difference.

# Mindset - A MountBlue Warrior Reference Manual

### Some one or more points that I want to take action on from the manual:
* **Become aware of your own mindset.** The first step to building a growth mindset is to become aware of your own mindset. What are your beliefs about intelligence and ability? Do you believe that your intelligence is fixed or can it be developed?
* **Challenge yourself.** One of the best ways to build a growth mindset is to challenge yourself. Set challenging goals for yourself and work hard to achieve them. When you face setbacks, don't give up. Learn from your mistakes and keep moving forward.
* **Celebrate your successes.** When you achieve a goal, take the time to celebrate your success. This will help you build confidence and motivation.

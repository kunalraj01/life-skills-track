## Steps/Strategies for Active Listening 

Active listening entails paying close attention, understanding, responding, and remembering what is heard. Here are the six most important steps/strategies for active listening:

* **Give your full focus**: Avoid distractions and focus on the speaker. Maintain eye contact, turn to face the person, and show genuine interest in what they are saying.

* **Avoid interrupting**: Allow the speaker to complete their thoughts before answering. Interruptions can break up a conversation and make the speaker feel unheard.

* **Use verbal and non-verbal cues**: Nodding, smiling, and giving appropriate verbal cues such as "I see," "I understand," or "Go on" encourage the speaker to keep talking.

* **Summarizing and resuming**: Reiterate the speaker's key points on a regular basis to demonstrate understanding and maintain clarity.

* **Inquire for clarification.**:When more information or clarification is required, seek it. This indicates your involvement and enthusiasm for the subject.

* **Avoid making assumptions and using your judgment.**: Maintain an open mind and avoid forming hasty judgments or assumptions about the speaker's message or intentions.

## Key points of Reflective Listening (Fisher's model)

Reflective listening, a subset of active listening, focuses on mimicking body language, emotions, and message verification. Fisher's paradigm for reflective listening has the following major points:

* **Mirroring emotions and body language**: Empathy and comprehension are demonstrated by reflecting on the speaker's nonverbal clues, such as facial expressions and movements.

* **Verification of the message**: Clarifying and restating the message in your own words to ensure that you correctly interpret what the speaker is trying to convey.

## Obstacles in the listening process

Several obstacles can hinder effective listening:

* **Distractions**: External factors like noise or interruptions can divert your attention away from the speaker.

* **Preconceived notions**: Having preconceived ideas or biases about the speaker or topic may lead to misinterpretation.

* **Emotional barriers**: Strong emotions, such as anger or excitement, can interfere with your ability to focus on the speaker's message.

* **Lack of interest**: When the topic is uninteresting or irrelevant, it becomes challenging to stay engaged.

* **Jumping to conclusions**: Making assumptions and finishing the speaker's thoughts prematurely can lead to misunderstandings.

## Improving your listening skills

To enhance your listening skills, consider the following:

* **Practice active listening**: Follow the steps mentioned in Question 1 to become a more attentive and engaged listener.

* **Be open-minded**: Approach conversations with an open mind, and try to understand the speaker's perspective without immediate judgment.

* **Reduce distractions**: Minimize external disturbances during important conversations.

* **Show empathy**: Try to empathize with the speaker's emotions and experiences to establish a stronger connection.

* **Ask for feedback**: Request feedback from others about your listening skills and areas for improvement.
